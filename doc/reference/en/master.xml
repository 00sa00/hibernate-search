    <para>Full text search engines like <productname>Apache
    Lucene</productname> are very powerful technologies to add efficient free
    text search capabilities to applications. However, they suffer several mismatches when
    dealing with object domain models. Amongst other things indexes have to be kept up to date and
    mismatches between index structure and domain model as well as query mismatches 
    have to be avoided.
    </para>
    <para>
    Hibernate Search indexes your domain model with the help of a few annotations,
    takes care of database/index synchronization and brings back
    regular managed objects from free text queries. To achieve this Hibernate Search
    is combining the power of <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> and  
    <ulink url="http://lucene.apache.org">Apache Lucene</ulink>.
